The ever-evolving digital domain has dramatically transformed the landscape of visual effects (VFX). From its origins in big-screen productions, VFX technology is now omnipresent in the gaming industry, enhancing the visualization of stories and actions. The Unity VFX Graph facilitates the creation of spellbinding experiences by enabling developers to craft interactive visual effects with ease. This undertaking aims to capture your creativity, showcasing your capacity to bring exhilarating VFX to life.

## Overview

Harness the power of Unity’s Visual Effects and Particle Systems to light up the virtual skies with your personalized firework display.

## Technical Description

This project encapsulates multiple key areas:

1. **Unity Particle System:** Delve into Unity’s particle system, mastering customizations, particle variations (billboard vs. 3D), and optimization for PC platforms.
2. **VFX Graph:** Excel at crafting spellbinding visual effects for a gallery of fireworks using Unity’s Visual Effects Graph, featuring a myriad of shapes, colors, and behaviors.
3. **Event System Architecture:** Develop an efficient event system to activate various visual effects within a controlled test environment.
4. **Performance Testing:** Confirm that your VFX creations operate efficiently on PC, ensuring fluid visuals and responsive interactions.


Notes:
Standard fireworks can be optimized for your machine by limiting the number of available fireworks at a time. You can also increase or decrease the explosin value to match performance requirements
Image fireworks can be scaled down to improve performance but can suffer from quality if scaled too far down as the image will not display properly
If the sparks trail is causing issue the easiest fix is to remove the noise property as it is the most taxing on average
Campfire can reduce amount of smoke and flames present from flipbook to improve performance
